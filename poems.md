Fantasies What Can They Be?  
  {: style="text-align:center"}
Fantasies, what can they be?  
But gallantry, or knavery,  
Or maybe even clarity.  
For bed time dreams can be psychiatry.   
  {: style="text-align:center"}
Fantasies, what can they be?  
A shadow cast by growing doubt,  
or hunger from a life without.  
For fear and shame lead to rout.  
  {: style="text-align:center"}
Fantasies, what can they be?  
Guiding signs along the way,  
Or the driving force for escapades.  
To remind us all of this game we play.  
  {: style="text-align:center"}
Fantasies, what can they be?  
Needless delves into reverie?  
Or closer to an energy?  
Can they be, nothing less than discovery?
