                    <h1>My Site</h1>
                    <p>I am using this website as a portfolio to showcase my design projects. As well as to highlight some of my other interests and activities. Hopefully this will serve as an inspiration to my peers, and I will post a short tutorial on how to set up a site like this.
                    </p>
                    <p>These projects are a mix of software, electrical, and purely mechanical components.

                        <p>I am a Mechanical Engineering Student at the University of Ottawa, Canada.</p>
                        <p>Diverse, would be the best way to describe me. I am of Moroccan, Indian, and German descent, and I have lived in six countries. My educational background is equally diverse, before pursuing my current degree I received a B.A. in Philosophy from McGill University.</p>
                        <p>The great polymaths of history are my idols, and as such, I strive to be excellent in many different activities. I am always engaged in learning new things. And I believe that having a diversity of perspective is essential to creating innovative solutions.</p>
                        <p>Hoping to engage in engineering projects that will bring more integrity to our everyday lives. Interested particularly in aerospace, AI, and cutting edge technologies.</p>
                        <p>I am actively looking for internship opportunities.</p>
