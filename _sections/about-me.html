<br>
<p>The great polymaths of history are my idols, and as such, I strive to learn as many different things as possible. I am always engaged in learning new things. And I believe that having a diversity of perspective is essential to creating innovative solutions. Hoping to engage in engineering projects that will bring more integrity to our everyday lives. Interested particularly in aerospace, AI, and cutting edge technologies.</p>
