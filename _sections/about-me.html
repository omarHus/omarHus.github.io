<p>I am a Mechanical Engineering Student at the University of Ottawa, Canada. Diverse, would be the best way to describe me. I am of Moroccan, Indian, and German descent, and I have lived in six countries. My educational background is equally diverse, before pursuing my current degree I received a B.A. in Philosophy from McGill University.</p>
<p>The great polymaths of history are my idols, and as such, I strive to be excellent in many different activities. I am always engaged in learning new things. And I believe that having a diversity of perspective is essential to creating innovative solutions. Hoping to engage in engineering projects that will bring more integrity to our everyday lives. Interested particularly in aerospace, AI, and cutting edge technologies. I am actively looking for internship opportunities.</p>

<h2>My Site</h2>
<p>I am using this website as a portfolio to showcase my design projects. As well as to highlight some of my other interests and activities. Hopefully this will serve as an inspiration to my peers, and I will post a short tutorial on how to set up a site like this.
