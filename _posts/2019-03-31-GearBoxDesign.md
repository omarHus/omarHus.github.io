The task for this project was to design a speed reducer given certain operational parameters. The focus was on making a simple, cheap, and easily manufactured design. A full analysis of the stresses on the gears, bearings and shafts was conducted, in order to design a gear box that met the given criteria.

The following table shows the criteria given for this particular gear box.

| Design Constraint | Input Power (HP)| Input Velocity (rpm)| Output Velocity (rpm)|
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Vertical to horizontal | 5 | 750 | 80 |

This corresponds to a speed reduction of 9.375. This is a relatively high reduction, so to achieve it in one step a worm gear was used with a triple thread and a wheel with 29 teeth. This corresponds to a speed reduction of 9.67, which is very close to our design requirement. A worm gear also transmits the rotation from a vertical to horizontal shaft, which meets our design constraint.

My principal task was to analyse the shafts in this gear box.
