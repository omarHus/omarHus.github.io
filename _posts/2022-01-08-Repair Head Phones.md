This is not technically a design project, but it's something that made me stop and realize how much I've learned in the last year.

My friend had broken his headphones and one side was no longer playing music, and he asked if I could fix it. So I opened it up and took out my multimeter and started investigating.

I had to find the ground, power, and signal connections. Eventually after a lot of probing I discovered that the left ear ground connection was no longer connected. So instead of looking for the cut wire and taking everything apart, I found a little hack.

<div class="4u 12u$(mobile)">
    <div class="item">
        <img class="image fit" src="{{ '/assets/images/beats_hack.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" />
            <!-- <header>
            <h3></h3>
            </header> -->
    </div>
</div>
</center>

I found another ground connection and soldered a wire between the left ear and ground. I plugged the audio jack and music came out of both ears!

My friend said that the headphones were even louder now :)

I could not have done something like this a year ago. So I'm really shocked at how much electrical knowledge I've been able to pick up in such a short time. Hoping to keep learning and keep growing, and also keep shocking myself (in a good way).
