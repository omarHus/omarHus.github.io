This Project is still a work in progress, and should be completed in the next few weeks (with CAD drawings and full results of the design)

The mandate for this class project consists of designing a machine that can quickly and effectively fold parachutes in a reproducible manner. The machine must be able to fold an eight-panel, dome-shaped parachute without any human intervention other than start-up and shut-down. No programmable controllers can be used and a limit of three electric motors is allowed.

The above figure is a rough sketch of the concept for this machine. It is similar to a photocopy machine which moves paper around using spinning shafts with rollers to push the paper along a predetermined path. It's nice to include a rough sketch of the idea, just to be able to compare with the finished project and to see how the design process is an iterative one.

The advantages of this design is that it uses one motor, with a gear transmission that allows for both the lateral and longitudinal folds of the parachute. Using bevel gears the lateral shafts can be engaged with the same motor. Another nice feature of this design is that it doesn't use complex parts to get the fold sequence correct, it instead, makes use of geometry to get all the folds.

The basic function is that the parachute is pushed along by the rollers, and then hits an end-stop on a flat inclined plate at a certain distance. This distance for the first fold is half the length of the parachute, which means that when the parachute hits the end-stop, the chute will be forced down a second set of shafts and rollers located underneath, which will engage the fold.

The following figure is a second iteration sketch with a little bit more embodiment, but still quite rough. Just gives a bit more of an idea of how the whole machine will work together without a lot of detail.
